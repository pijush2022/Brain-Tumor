##Tumor Detection Using Image Segmentation
This project implements a tumor detection system using image segmentation techniques with a focus on medical imaging. The U-Net deep learning model is applied to segment brain MRI images, identifying and localizing tumor regions.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilizes the Kaggle Brain MRI dataset for glioma tumor segmentation.
Preprocessing: Images are normalized, resized, and converted to grayscale.
Model: U-Net architecture, which efficiently captures both low- and high-level features, is employed for segmentation.
Training & Evaluation: The model is trained using MRI images and corresponding masks, achieving accurate tumor localization. Evaluation includes accuracy metrics and visual representation of the tumor regions.
Output: Segmented tumor regions are highlighted and overlaid on the original MRI images for better visualization.
Skills & Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
Image Processing Tools: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Machine Learning Techniques: Image Segmentation, U-Net, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Data Handling: Train-Test split (using scikit-learn), data normalization, and augmentation.
Medical Imaging: MRI scans, Tumor segmentation
Architecture: U-Net (Encoder-Decoder structure with skip connections)
Development Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
Steps:
Dataset setup and loading.
Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization).
U-Net model implementation.

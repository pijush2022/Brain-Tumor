3. Architecture: U-Net Model
The U-Net architecture is well-suited for medical image segmentation due to its encoder-decoder structure:

Encoder: Captures spatial features and reduces the image size.
Decoder: Reconstructs the original image while localizing features.
Skip Connections: Help preserve spatial information between corresponding encoder and decoder layers.

4. Dataset Setup
We utilize the Kaggle Brain MRI dataset for glioma tumor segmentation. The dataset contains:

MRI Images: Raw brain scans.
Tumor Masks: Binary masks showing tumor presence.
The dataset is split into training and test sets.


# Import necessary libraries
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load and preprocess images and masks
def load_data(image_dir, mask_dir, img_size=(128, 128)):
    # Your code here...
<a name="preprocessing"></a>

5. Image Preprocessing
The MRI images are resized to a fixed size (128x128), normalized, and converted to grayscale. This is crucial for efficient model training and to ensure uniformity across the dataset.


# Normalize images
images = images / 255.0
masks = masks / 255.0

6. U-Net Model
The U-Net model is defined using TensorFlow/Keras and follows an encoder-decoder architecture. Skip connections between the layers help in learning both high- and low-level features.


from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Define the U-Net architecture
def unet_model(input_size=(128, 128, 1)):
    inputs = layers.Input(input_size)
    # Encoder and decoder layers here...
    model = models.Model(inputs=[inputs], outputs=[outputs])
    return model

# Compile the model
model = unet_model()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
<a name="training"></a>

7. Training the Model
The U-Net model is trained on the MRI images and their corresponding tumor masks. We use a train-test split to ensure the model can generalize well to unseen data.



# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_split=0.1, epochs=20, batch_size=16)
<a name="evaluation"></a>

8. Evaluation
Once trained, the model is evaluated on the test set. Accuracy and loss metrics are used to gauge performance.


# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}')
<a name="results"></a>

9. Results & Visualization
The segmented tumor regions are highlighted and overlaid on the original MRI images for visualization. This helps in verifying the accuracy of the predictions.


# Display test images with predicted masks
for i in range(5):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    # Display original, true mask, and predicted mask
